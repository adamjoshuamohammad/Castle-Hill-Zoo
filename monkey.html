    <h2>About</h2>
    <p id="description">
        The golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana) is an Old World monkey in the subfamily Colobinae. 
        It is endemic to a small area in temperate, mountainous forests of central and Southwest China.
        They inhabit these mountainous forests of Southwestern China at elevations of 1,500–3,400 m (4,900–11,200 ft) above sea level. 
        The Chinese name is Sichuan golden hair monkey (四川金丝猴). It is also widely referred to as the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey.
        Of the three species of snub-nosed monkeys in China, the golden snub-nosed monkey is the most widely distributed throughout China.
        Snow occurs frequently within its range, and it can withstand colder average temperatures better than any other non-human primate. 
        Its diet varies markedly with the seasons, but it is primarily a herbivore with lichens being its main food source. 
        It is diurnal and largely arboreal, spending some 97% of its time in the canopy. There are three subspecies. 
        Population estimates range from 8,000 to 15,000 and it is threatened by habitat loss.
