    <h2>About</h2>
    <p id="description">
        Protobothrops mangshanensis, commonly known as the Mangshan pit viper, is a venomous pit viper species endemic to Hunan and Guangdong provinces in China. No subspecies are currently recognized. 
        This is a nocturnal pit viper that is also known as the "Mangshan iron-head snake", "Chinese pit viper", and the "Ironhead viper". 
        They eat frogs, birds, insects, and small mammals. They have a white tail tip that they wiggle to mimic a grub so that prey comes into striking range—a behaviour known as caudal luring. 
        The venom causes blood clotting and corrodes muscle tissue and can kill people. Unusually for vipers, P. mangshanensis is oviparous with the female laying clutches of 13–21 eggs which she will guard until they hatch.
