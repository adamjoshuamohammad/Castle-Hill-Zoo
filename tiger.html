    <h2>About</h2>
    <p id="info">
        The South China tiger is a tiger from a specific population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies that is native to southern China. The population mainly inhabited the Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. 
        It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1996 and is possibly extinct in the wild since no wild individual has been recorded since the late 1980s.
        In the late 1990s, continued survival was considered unlikely because of low prey density, widespread habitat degradation and fragmentation, and other human pressures.

    <p id="info">
        The tiger is an obligate carnivore. It prefers hunting large ungulates, frequently kills wild boar, and occasionally hog deer, muntjac and gray langur. Small prey species such as porcupines, hares and peafowl form a very small part in its diet.

    <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
    <p id="info">
        South China Tigers are relatively small compared to its other subspecies. Compared to other tigers, they have broad stripes, each spaced far apart; thus, making their coat more attractive.
        South China Tigers also have plenty of distinct markings around their face, making each tiger unique.
